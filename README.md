# Angle Encoder
Xilinx hardware and software design for an angle encoder to be attached to motors on Siena's Viper telescope.

Included in repository:


1. Vivado Design Suite Block Design (.xpr and associated files)

2. Software Development Kit (Source file(.c)) 

Note: Both designs were created using the 2014.4 versions of the Xilinx tools,  so some editing will be in order when importing the specs to later versions.
